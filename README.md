# STM32-F407-TFT-Display
The project will utilize the 3.5-inch TFT LCD (Wireshark clone), ILI9486 chip, with the STM32F407VGT6 dev kit. An additional adapter layer is needed over the original Wireshark driver for LVGL compatibility (`Core/Inc/ili9846_lvgl.h`, and `Core/Src/ili9846_lvgl.c`). This adapter layer is inspired by the ILI9341 driver, following this tutorial: https://controllerstech.com/lvgl-on-stm32-part-1/
